# String Calculator
This is a simple implementation of a string calculator that can handle various input formats and custom delimiters. It also performs basic validation for negative numbers.

### Requirements

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check if Ruby is installed by running the following command:

```bash
ruby -v
```
If Ruby is not installed, you can install it from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
.

## How to Run the Test Cases
To run the test cases, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary files in your project directory: `string_calculator.rb` and `string_calculator_test.rb`.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing both files.

3. Run the test cases using the following command:
```bash
ruby string_calculator_test.rb
```
